      <h1>What EcoEats do</h1>
      <p>
        EcoEats is revolutionizing the way we donate clothes through its
        innovative web app platform. Dedicated to sustainability and social
        responsibility, EcoEats facilitates the seamless donation of clothing to
        NGOs, ensuring that unwanted garments find new homes and purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a user-friendly interface, individuals can easily schedule pickups
        for their homes, making the process convenient and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        By partnering with trusted NGOs, EcoEats ensures that every contribution
        makes a meaningful impact in communities in need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we're not only reducing textile waste but also supporting
        those who can benefit most from gently used clothing. Join us in making
        a difference, one donation at a time.
